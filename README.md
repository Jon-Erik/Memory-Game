# Memory Game

##### React web game created with `create-react-app` npm package

This web based memory game is built using the React.js library. Using a classical music theme, 12 different tiles are displayed with pictures of different classical composers. The user attempts to click on each composer only once and the tiles are shuffled on each click. The user's score is calculated on how many tiles have been clicked only once and the top score is recorded for each browser session. If the user clicks a tile that has already been clicked, the user is notified and the game is reset.
